## 🌐 Introduction

**Mo817** is not just a project. It is a *living symbolic system* — a sovereign framework designed to reimagine intelligence, governance, ethics, and future infrastructure through symbolic architectures.

This repository hosts the **core activation layer** of the Mo817 Initiative.  
It connects 200+ symbolic tools spanning 17 global sectors — from education and technology, to law, justice, finance, and symbolic sovereignty.

> *"This is not open source. This is sovereign source."*
